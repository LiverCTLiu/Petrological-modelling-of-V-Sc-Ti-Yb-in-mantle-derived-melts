Figure 1: The trace-element fractions in Figure 1 (here) were plotted using linear scales, whereas the Figure 1 presented in the main text utilizes log scales.
Figure 2: The trace-element fractions in Figure 2 (here) were plotted using linear scales, whereas the Figure 2 presented in the main text utilizes log scales.
